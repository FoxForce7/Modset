# -Issues, Suggested  Mods and Change Discussion-


#### 
            NIArms NIArsenal:


                Need a weapons/ammo list to choose from. Separate doc?


                Csathdfw: **hlc/nia** is debateable, cuz the minimum (ar15/ak/saw/mp5) is already present as vanilla assets, the rest requires special mags which makes ammoshare unfeasable unless we make a indepth ammo-compat for them, but would provide alot of diversity in both arsenal and scenarios possible. Also we can wait abit with hlc/nia cuz toadie is prepping a huge update to it currently


                Newsparta: having some M16's or whatever is fine by me, but limited to just maybe some M16 types and thats it, we dont need eastern weapons or any odd not often used euro weapons (HK as an exception).


#### 
            VSM Gear:


                Need list to choose from. Separate doc?


                What was that small extra mod/config that gave more default enemy loadouts?


                Csathdfw: **vsm gear** highly desired, I would only try to remove special camo variants like the project honor from it to reduce both size and arsenal lists (I believe whigi made that vsm compat and I would just continue using it when vsm makes its way into the modpack)


                Newsparta: prob want VSM but not a high priority for me.


#### RH scopes and accessories:

**	**

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SYYXVO57xcZEz47jk-zHwBXwLtLb090CO8BOq5Ef720/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SYYXVO57xcZEz47jk-zHwBXwLtLb090CO8BOq5Ef720/edit?usp=sharing)

	Csathdfw: **rh accessories** highly desired, small size and no (or minor) fps loss, theyre fully ace compatible and add a healthy amount and diversity of scopes and weapon attachments to our arsenal and scenarios

	Vad: This one can be trimed down, half the scopes are useless, no need for harris bipods, the lasers arent the good flash/laser combo ones. \
 \
Newsparta: Vanilla scopes are more than enough imo.


#### 
             ADR97:


                Do we want it? 


                Cons: just a single gun not used much


                Pros: ???


                Csathdfw: **p90** is useless


                Vad: vanilla f2000 is pretty similar anyways


                Newsparta: mostly worthless mod imo.


#### 
            Ivory cars:


                Do we want it? 


                Cons: ???


                Pros: ???


                Csathdfw: **ivory cars** are partially desired, I find them very useful as props for missionmakers and the occasional fuck-around, they dont eat any fps unless used in very large numbers. Also these versions of ivory cars are not on steamworkshop or elsewhere, theyre actually somewhat exclusive for ff7 and a (personal) shame to ditch them. Ido have sourcecode for some of them and I plan on making a compat for it again to "fix" the wheels durability from 0.2 to 0.3, which wont make them break on driving over bridges anymore, but still still keep the cars unsuitable for military operations. (I may contact dezkit to get the sourcecode for the caddie escalades to produce an additional, but armored version of them, which also may have firing from vehicles functionality)

	Vad: [http://www.armaholic.com/list.php?c=arma3_files_addons_vehicles_wheeled](http://www.armaholic.com/list.php?c=arma3_files_addons_vehicles_wheeled) heres a bunch we havent played with yet, I think we judge them on a per car basis.

	Newsparta: I dont particularly like them… not that i dont mind having more civie vehicles but the ivory cars look wierd compared to vanilla assets, there are a bunch of generic looking sedans and low key cars in the game and then all the sudden you add irl brand name fancy cars and it just blows my immersion.


#### 
            Tactical Beards:


                Should we add them?


                Why: looks cool


                Why not?: 2014, anything newer?


                Csathdfw: **Beards** are small and dont eat fps but just look bad


                Newsparta: these are bad imo, just aesthetic and can sometimes be immersion breaking, only guerilla/spec ops are allowed beards so it just always feels like we are playing with no structure or always elite status.


#### TF47 Launchers:

**	**Do we need them now MAAWS is standard? What about AT4, other mods?

	Csathdfw: **tf47 launchers **kinda same as nia/hlc, some of its contents already available as vanilla assets and not really superb compared to those, but they work fine and would add abit (but not too much)  more diversity to our arsenal/scenarios.

	Newsparta: vanilla has a MAAWS and tbh base game > mod every time for me, id rather use the vanilla assets rather than add tf47 launhers.


#### Maps:

	Can we get cups maps that dont require the 7GB additional core pack?

	Csathdfw: **additional maps** can only be without cup/aia dependency, because with cup dependency, they always require the full cup or the modular cup pack, which both amount to 7-9.5gb no matter what. There is enough good maps out there which dont have any dependency (and therefor use a3 assets woohoo)

	Vad:I say we do one extra map for now, and rotate maps each update to keep size down? I vote Fallujah.

Newsparta: my opinion is mostly moot, i like stratis, altis, tanoa, malden… thats it, i dont like any CUP or community maps


#### 
            FF7 compats & stuff:


                What is this?


                -Patches in the (ff7 pbo).


                -Health Status mod for Ace (health status pbo). 


                -Additional weather, adds snow/storm to zeus (needs work to make into dialog box)(extraweather.pbo)


                -CHVD, change view distance, by hotkey only, default bind is "ctrl+\"(CHVD.pbo)


                -Cleanup script, needs work to let mission makers/zeus turn it off (cleanup.pbo)


                Csathdfw: ff7 mods/compats are QualityOfLife improvements aswell as providing compatibility between mods of the modpacks, they currently hold a number improvements such as, but not limited to, magazine compats and ammo infos and we will expand on that further in the future.
